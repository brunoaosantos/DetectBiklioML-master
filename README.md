# DetectBiklioML-master

This project aims to detect cycling activity. 
It is based on woorti application and uses the Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to detect the activities.
For that are used two different sensors, the accelerometer and the GPS.
For each are calculated different features.
